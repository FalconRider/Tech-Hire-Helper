Another hyper casual development exercise: Need help deciding who gets the Job and proving you weren't biased? Ask a computer and a pseudo-random generated proof is yours. Based on the classic "Magic 8 Ball" Just wanted to again practice going from concept to delivery on another derivative idea. And  it's all good Github practice too!
